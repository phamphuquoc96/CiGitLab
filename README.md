## App Overview

We love pizza at This Dot! The demo is an app for our fictional pizza restaurant.

There are two tabs: **Menu and Orders**

The menu tab is a list of the available pizzas to order. You can also build your own pizza using the first button at the top of the screen.

### Build your own

On this screen you can add and remove toppings from your pizza, select the size, see the total price, and submit your order.

### Menu item options

After selecting an item from the menu list you will be taken to a screen that lets you pick the size and see the final price before submitting your order.

### Orders

Orders comes with one previously delivered order populated by default. Any pizzas you create or order will be added to your order screen.

## E2E Test Cases

We want to write e2e tests to cover these user flows

- [ ] User can navigate to orders to see previous orders
- [ ] User can pick an item from the menu, select a size and options, and place an order
- [ ] User can create their own pizza and order it
